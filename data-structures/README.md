# Data-Structures
With the help of this repository, I'm trying to demonstrate my knowledge of different data structures and the ability to implement it in my way. Here you can find implementations of the following data structures with simple tests:

* **Stack** is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is Last In First Out _(LIFO)_.

* **Queue** is a linear structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out _(FIFO)_.

* **Binary Search Tree(BST)** is a particular type of container: a data structure that stores in this case integers (but it can be any data) in memory. BST allows fast lookup, addition and removal of items, and can be used to implement either dynamic sets of items, or lookup tables that allow finding an item by its key (e.g., finding the phone number of a person by name). 

* **Hash Map(Hash Table)** is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values. A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. 

* **Heap** is a specialized tree-based data structure which is essentially an almost complete tree that satisfies the heap property: in a max heap, for any given node C, if P is a parent node of C, then the key (the value) of P is greater than or equal to the key of C. In a min heap, the key of P is less than or equal to the key of C. The node at the "top" of the heap (with no parents) is called the root node. 

* **SkipList** is a probabilistic data structure that is built upon the general idea of a linked list. The skip list uses probability to build subsequent layers of linked lists upon an original linked list. Each additional layer of links contains fewer elements, but no new elements.

* **Find Union** is a data structure that tracks a set of elements partitioned into some disjoint (non-overlapping) subsets. It provides near-constant-time operations (bounded by the inverse Ackermann function) to add new sets, to merge existing sets, and to determine whether elements are in the same set. In addition to many other uses (see the Applications section), disjoint-sets play a key role in Kruskal's algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree of a graph.  

* **Double Linked List** is a linked data structure that consists of a set of sequentially linked records called nodes. Each node contains three fields: two link fields (references to the previous and the next node in the sequence of nodes) and one data field.
