# Graph-Algorithms
With the help of this repository, I'm trying to demonstrate my knowledge of different graph algorithms and the ability to implement it in my way. Here you can find implementations of the following graph algorithms:

* **Breadth First Search (BFS)**  is an algorithm for traversing or searching graph. The algorithm starts at the some arbitrary node as the root node and explores all of the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.

* **Depth First Search (DFS)** is an algorithm for traversing or searching graph. The algorithm starts at the some arbitrary node as the root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

* **Topological Sort** is a linear ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge uv from vertex u to vertex v, u comes before v in the ordering. For instance, the vertices of the graph may represent tasks to be performed, and the edges may represent constraints that one task must be performed before another; in this application, a topological ordering is just a valid sequence for the tasks.

* **Dijkstra's Algorithm** is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a weighted graph, which may represent, for example, road networks.
